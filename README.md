    Rules explained: 

    The game is about decision-making. The character needs to decide whether to bend over the exigences of the society or protect its true identity.

    If the character decides to bend over to fit the assigned role, new path (rectangles) will light up. 

    If the character decides to stick with its own identity, new path (rectangles) will be closed forever.

    At the end of the questions, the character can choose a path to enter, and a specific final end will be given to the character. If no path is available, the character has the choice to choose none and be directed to a bad ending. If the character does not want to enter any specific end, it may choose none and be directed to a bad ending.

4. Society and Game Page

    Player may proceed to the next question only if the previous one has been answered.

## Artistic Vision

All the visual elements are made by myself. The style incorporates both traditional Chinese ink painting, and modern simplicity of the abstract. The scenes are all from Dali (my homeland), which is the self-governed territory of the Bai people which I am part of. Scenes such as the three pagodes, the lake (Erhai) and the bird view of the village (He qing, the village my grand-mother comes from and where I passed the happiest moments of my childhood) are all historically part of the Nan Zhao kingdom (738-902) where the legend happened.

## Research on Clothing

Here are some (not all) reference photos taken from old painting of the Nan Zhao kingdom that I based on for the characters:

## Codes requirements:
I have incorporated all the concepts learnt in class: drawing instructions (yes), images (a lot), conditionals (a lot), loops (for the soul animation, image preloads, maze, the clues, the clue buttons, etc.), functions (yes), arrays (a lot), object-oriented programming (maze, clues, clue buttons), and the sound library (musics and sound effect when there is a collision with the maze).
