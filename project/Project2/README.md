## Concept Overview

The film I decided to go with is "Farewell my Concubine" by Chen Kaige. One very important theme in the film revolves around self-identity and the conflicting pressure from the society, which is what inspired my game. 

The main character, Cheng Dieyi (meaning "Butterflie's Cloth"), is the son of a prostitute. At an early age, his mom entrusted him at an all-boy opera troupe. Growing up in the opera troupe, he was assigned to play dan (female roles), and more specifically, the character of Yuji (a concubine of the King of Chu). While practicing the play, Dieyi has to say "I am by nature a girl, not a boy", but he always accidentally substitute the line with "I am by nature a boy, not a girl." His master beats him to bleed until he said that line correctly. This is the one of the early signs of his conflicting self-identification and what is demanded from his part.

Several incidents happened later in his life, where he witnessed suicides, death, betrayal, invasion from foreign countries and has been sexually assaulted. When Dieyi grew up, he fell in love with an actor of the troupe playing the King of Chu. However, as China experienced reforms, invasions, and civil revolutions, several cultural sectors have been destroyed, including Pekin Opera that gradually losts its place in society. People in the troupe ended leaving, and with the cultural revolution, the entire opera troupe is put on a struggle session by the Red Guards where, under pressure, Dieyi and his loved-one ended up accusing each other for counterrevolutionary acts (which none of them committed).
In 1977, Dieyi and his loved-one re-united to perform again the same opera piece, as several traditional sectors re-gained importance. Dieyi made the same mistake again when saying "I am by nature a girl, not a boy". But this time, he did not correct himself. At the end of the opera, as Yuji, the concubine he was playing, suicides for the King of Chu, Dieyi cuts his throat with the sword, and this time, played the role for real.

With my game, Paper Man, I want to reflect on this theme, to see how one choose to balance the values deeply rooted and the pressure to behave in a certain way that is imposed by external factors. 



## Film Synopsis

Taken from wikipedia: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell_My_Concubine_(film))

Farewell My Concubine is a 1993 Chinese historical drama film directed by Chen Kaige, starring Leslie Cheung, Gong Li, and Zhang Fengyi. Adapted for the screen by Lu Wei based on the novel by Lilian Lee, the film is set in a politically tumultuous 20th-century China, from the early days of the Republic to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. It chronicles the troubled relationships between two Peking opera actors and lifelong friends Cheng Dieyi (Cheung) and Duan Xiaolou (Zhang), and Xiaolou's wife Juxian (Gong).

The movie is about confusion of identity and blurred lines between real life and the stage, portrayed by the revered opera actor Dieyi, whose unrequited love for Xiaolou persists through the movie. Scholar Ying notes that in order "[to] attract the international audience, Chinese history and Peking Opera are drawn close while homosexuality, individual perversities and moral dilemmas are transposed distant".[2] Commentators also noted themes of political and societal disturbances in 20th-century China, which is typical of the Chinese Fifth Generation cinema.

Farewell My Concubine premiered on January 1, 1993, in Hong Kong. Upon release, the film received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics and won the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival,[note 1] becoming the first Chinese-language film to achieve the honour. It further won accolades including a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and a BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and received two nominations at the 66th Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film.

A few weeks after its release in China the government abruptly banned the film. The Chinese government objected to the filmâ€™s representation of homosexuality and suicide[citation needed]. The film was allowed to resume public showings in September of 1993, less than a year after its original release. Upon its return to the public, it was revealed that the Chinese censors made numerous cuts, resulting in the film being shortened by 14 minutes.

Chinese officials felt that a re-release of the film as opposed to maintaining a full ban would silence ever-growing international backlash and also help their bid to host the Olympic games in Beijing in 2000.[3][4]

Farewell My Concubine is considered one of the landmark films of the Fifth Generation movement that brought Chinese film directors to world attention.[5][6] In 2005, the film was selected as one of the "100 Best Films in Global History" by Time magazine.
